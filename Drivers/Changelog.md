## Package v9.1 / Driver v06.00.05  (16th Sept 2021)

The following updates are included in this release.

14. A compilation flag (_DGB_LOG) has been added to allow for debug strings to
   be enabled/disabled as a project needs them.

15. Fixes added for dwt_isr() when STS No Data packets are used. There was a

3. Bug in deca_compat.c where dwt_read_reg() was returning 0.

4. Fixing function that write the PDoA Offset in deca_compat.c under
   case: “DWT_SETPDOAOFFSET”. The value to be written is ANDed with the
   inverse of CIA_ADJUST_PDOA_ADJ_OFFSET_BIT_MASK.

## Package v7.0 / Driver v02.00.00  (13th April 2021)

In addition to the existing updated driver layout for CR5 release. Following
updates are included in this release changed from ER1 release.

1. Update in the function dwt_setgpiomode():
   This function will now // clear GPIO which has been specified by the mode
   (Each mode takes up 3 bits) and set GPIO mask as specified to enable it for
   individual GPIO or multiple GPIOs.

2. Update in the dwt_isr() function:
   Clear SPI RDY events after the callback - this lets the host read the
   SYS_STATUS register inside the callback "after" calling the corresponding
   callback if present.

3. Fixes for PLL re-calibration. PLL_CAL_EN_BIT needs to be set when PLL is
   calibrated. Updated dwt_setdwstate().

4. Wakeup (from sleep) times have been shortened from 500us to 200us.

5. Updated STS_CONFIG_HI_RES – the STS threshold to >=60%, so that only if
   STS qual is < 60%, the STS_CQ_EN bit will be set in the STS_TOAST register.

6. New DGC LUTs, change in the OTP values, the dwt_initialise() has been
   updated to check the OTP contains the new LUTs, and only if it does the
   driver will load/kick them from OTP, otherwise the values in the driver
   (refer API guide for more information) be loaded/written into the device.

7. Added new dwt_adcoffsetscalibration() API which is called at the end of
   dwt_configure to optimize receiver / configure optimal ADC thresholds.

8. _dwt_adjust_delaytime() – this has been updated for the delayed TX w.r.t
   RX timestamp. As TX/RX antenna delay is automatically added to the TX/RX
   timestamp, the antenna delay is subtracted from the delayed TX time.

9. Only disable STS CMF when PDOA mode 1 is used.

10. Fix for channel power parameter in the diagnostic structure, the parameter
   has been changed to 32 bits as the corresponding bitfield has been
   increased to 20-bits.

11. Simple Examples updated are same as CR5 except:
    * Double Buffer RX example:
        This example has a check for device ID. If the device ID is not from E0
        samples. The test will go into a forever while loop.

    * Timer example:
        This example has a check for device ID. If the device ID is not from E0
        samples. The test will go into a forever while loop.

    * GPIO example:
        This example has a check for device ID to select the GPIO mask for C0
        and E0. If the device ID is not from E0 samples. User will be required
        to select the single GPIO (1,2,3 ..) or multiple GPIOs (GPIO_ALL) from
        enum that needs to be enabled.


## Package v6.0 / Driver v05.00.00  (10th October 2019)

1. New driver layout has been added as part of this release. A "compatibility
   layer" is now in use. Each example now requires a dwt_probe() API call
   before dwt_initialise() API call. In previous releases, dwt_initialise()
   was always the first API to be called. This is no longer the case. Please
   see API Guide for more information.

2. Issues with XTAL trim values have been fixed.

3. Simple Examples with STS enabled will now check STS status and STS quality.
   STS status checking will not work if the Ipatov preamble length is 64 or
   less. In this case, the user should only check for STS quality.

4. Various fixes to SS-TWR and DS-TWR examples to use a single delay value
   between RX/TX rather than different values for different supported
   platforms.

5. Simple Examples will no longer reference deca_regs.h directly. Various new
   APIs have been created to accommodate for this. Please see API Guide for
   more information.

6. Simple Examples release has removed some unnecessary files and changed the
   layout of the code. Each supported build platform (STM & Nordic) now has
   its own directory.

7. The “DWT_PGFCAL” argument has been added to all dwt_configuresleep() API
   calls in the example code. This allows for the receiver to be re-enabled
   after sleep (on-wake).

8. Wakeup (from sleep) times have been shortened from 500us to 200us.

9. Interrupt flag names have changed slightly from previous release. For
   example, “SYS_ENABLE_LO_TXFRS_ENABLE_BIT_MASK” is now
   “DWT_INT_TXFRS_BIT_MASK”.

10. New Simple Examples added:
    * PLL calibration example:
        This example will monitor the temperature of the device. If there is a
        significant change in temperature, the PLL is re-calibrated.
    * Bandwidth calibration example:
        This example will record the initial PG count (emulating what should be
        done in factory). The example will recalibrate the bandwidth given this
        reference PG count value in a loop over time. The example should be run
        in a temperature chamber over a range of operating temperatures. The
        device will output a continuous frame for bandwidth monitoring on a
        spectrum analyser.

11. Simple Example changes:
    * Continuous frame example:
        The continuous frame example will now disable the transmission of the
        frame before resetting. Users can add a breakpoint in to monitor this on
        a spectrum analyser.


## Package v5.0 / Driver v01.03.12  (10th October 2019)


1. Fix for gearing table selection and SCP coding threshold, VCM and TX power
values have been increased by 3dB to improve performance.

2. Wakeup pin functionality tested. Wake up pin is configured as FORCE_ON by
default. It needs to be reconfigured to WAKE_UP before wake-up functionality
can be tested.

3. Fixed dwt_entersleepaftertx - which was setting a wrong bit.

4. PLEN 32 was configuring the device to transmit 40 symbols. This has been
fixed.

5. Added multi-config IEEE 802.15.4 (BPRF) example that can use 32 different
configurations.

## Package v4.0 / Driver v01.03.0b  (31st May 2019)

1. Updated CIA configurations, this improved timestamping accuracy.

2. Updated PLL cal, a manual cal is necessary to ensure proper PLL
calibration/locking before device can switch to IDLE_PLL state.

3. Added example TX_SLEEP with auto PLL cal – this can be used to show how
device may stay in IDLE_RC after wakeup and then automatically calibrate PLL
just before TX.

4. Added IEEE 802.15.4 (BPRF) examples (simple TX and RX with new cipher
configuration, 1g and 2g).

5. Added SS TWR with IEEE 802.15.4 (BPRF) configuration example.

6. Added RX Sniff mode example.

Ipatov PRF of 64 MHz.

2. Fix LFSR advance API (dwt_cplfsradvance).

3. Updated dwt_configure() and dwt_enable_rf_tx() APIs – correct PDOA switch
configuration for AOA devices.
