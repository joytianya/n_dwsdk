# Device Scripts Introduction

The **device** directory introduces general functionality which is not related
with any specific feature, but with a device itself. It means that in order to
invoke these scripts you need a connected device. These scripts will
communicate with a device using UCI interface.

Example scripts from this chapter are getting some information from a device,
like statistics, firmware version or operations with calibration (get/set).

To learn more about detailed use cases, please read the subsequent chapters
or README.md files in the appropriate subdirectories.
