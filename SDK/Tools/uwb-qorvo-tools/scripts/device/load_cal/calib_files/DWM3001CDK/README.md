# DWM3001CDK

This directory contains a default calibration and configuration JSON file for the DWM3001CDK kit. The development board integrates a UWB transceiver module based on the Qorvo DW3110 IC with an attached planar Dual-Hoe (WB007) antenna and nRF52833 MCU.

As the development kit does not support the AoA capabilities, only one default calibration file is available:

- **dual-hoe_non_aoa.json**: This file contains default calibration and configuration settings for the `DWM3001CDK` setup not supporting AoA.
