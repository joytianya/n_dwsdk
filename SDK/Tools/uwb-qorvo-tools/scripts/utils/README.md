# Utilities Scripts Introduction

The **utils** directory contains general utilities that function as standalone
tools or supporting scripts for the UQT package. These scripts are designed
to work independently, without need of a connected device or communicating
with any devices.

To learn more about detailed use cases, please read the subsequent chapters
or README.md files in the appropriate subdirectories.
