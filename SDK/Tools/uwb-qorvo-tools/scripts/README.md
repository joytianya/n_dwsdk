# Scripts Introduction

The **scripts** directory serves as the core functional hub of UQT library,
housing a collection of essential scripts designed to provide a wide array
of functionalities. Whether you are looking to manage devices, run UWB
use cases, or handle specific scenarios, you'll find the tools you need here.

Each subdirectory within this folder is dedicated to a specific area of
functionality, ensuring that the scripts are well-organized and easy to navigate.
Within this directory, you'll encounter scripts that communicate with devices
via UCI, alongside standalone "offline" tools and UQT supporting scripts.

For detailed information on how to use these scripts, please refer to the
subsequent chapters or the README.md files located within the appropriate
subdirectories. These resources will guide you through the specific use cases
and help you make the most out of the available tools.
