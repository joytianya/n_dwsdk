# run_fira_test_per_rx

Script **run_fira_test_per_rx** is provided to demonstrate the FiRa PER RX Test. In the Packet/bit Error Rate RX Test mode, the UWBS continues to look for UWB packets in a timely fashion (T_GAP) until a configured number of packets (NUM_PACKETS) have elapsed. The timing of the packet starts only after the successful reception of the first packet, otherwise UWBS looks for the first packet indefinitely. This test mode can be used to measure the receiver sensitivity of the UWB device.

```
The PER RX Test shall be triggered by using TEST_PER_RX_CMD command.

The TEST_PER_RX_CMD command shall be issued only after applying all required Configuration parameters and the “Device Test Mode” session SHALL be in SESSION_STATE_IDLE Session State, otherwise UWBS will respond TEST_PER_RX_RSP with Status of STATUS_ERROR_SESSION_NOT_CONFIGURED indicating that session is not configured.

The UWBS shall respond TEST_PER_RX_RSP with the status of STATUS_OK and start PER Test. The number of packets to be received over UWB is configured by the NUM_PACKETS APP Configuration Parameter. UWBS shall notify TEST_PER_RX_NTF notification after completing the PER Rx test.
