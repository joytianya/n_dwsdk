/**
 * DOC: Objects Pack allocator.
 *
 * The objects pack allocator allows allocation of objects of mixed types,
 * packed together in blocks. Objects are allocated one by one, but all objects
 * of a single pack are released together in one operation.
 *
 * Blocks are allocated from the block allocator. The objects pack allocator is
 * designed to handle small objects, but each object can be as large as the
 * block size minus the block node header. If larger objects needs to be stored,
 * they must be cut in smaller pieces.
 *
 * A destructor can be associated to a pack, it is called before the pack is
 * released.
 *
 * An objects pack can have a root object, the first allocated object. The
 * pointer to this root object is sufficient for operations on the objects pack
 * and there is no need to keep a pointer to the pack structure.
 *
 * Quality of Service
 * ------------------
 *
 * The allocator uses the same levels of service as the block allocator. All
 * objects inside a single pack use the same level.
 *
 * Locking
 * -------
 *
 * Operations on a single pack are not thread safe, the user must protect itself
 * from concurrent access if needed. Operations on different packs are thread
 * safe as they do not share any data, they inherit the thread safety of the
 * block allocator.
 *
 * Performance
 * -----------
 *
 * Most allocations should be O(1). However, in some cases, doing a small
 * allocation after large ones which fill the blocks may force the allocator to
 * scan the used blocks to skip the blocks with not enough room for the small
 * allocation. This is a trade-off to optimize block usage when small and large
 * allocation are mixed.
 *
 * Release of the whole pack is O(1).
