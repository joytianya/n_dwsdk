/**
 * DOC: Block allocator.
 *
 * The block allocator allows allocation of blocks of a fixed size. Each block
 * can be used as a simple chunk of memory without any specific structure, or
 * can be connected to a chain of other blocks.
 *
 * Blocks are allocated from a pool which must be initialized before use with
 * a linear chunk of memory.
 *
 * Allocation of one block is O(1). Release of one block is O(1).
 *
 * When using a chain of blocks, releasing any number of blocks is O(1).
 *
 * There is three levels of API depending on your needs:
 *
 * - The block API, handling pointers to block nodes. This is supposed to be
 *   used with structures embedding a &struct qblk_node and it allows chaining.
 *   Use &qparent_of and field reference to convert between your pointer and
 *   the block node pointer.
 * - The raw memory API, handling pointers to a pack of bytes.
 * - The object API, handling casting to your own type for you.
 *
 * Quality of Service
 * ------------------
 *
 * The allocator handles two levels of service: sensitive and best-effort.
 *
 * Sensitive allocations are expected to succeed. They are used to allocate
 * memory for which failure is complex to handle, or may lead to an undesired
 * loss of performance. Sensitive allocation does fail when there is really no
 * memory left in the pool.
 *
 * Best-effort allocations are to be used for everything else. Allocations must
 * be short-lived so that memory can be returned for sensitive allocations if
 * needed.
 *
 * When allocating at the best effort level, if the number of free block would
 * become less than the configured reserve, the allocation is denied. The
 * reserve is not the total number of blocks reserved for sensitive allocations,
 * it rather corresponds to a kind of burst reserve, sufficient until
 * best-effort allocated memory is released.
 *
 * QMalloc variant
 * ---------------
 *
 * A QMalloc variant is available in qblk_qmalloc library, allowing easier
 * transition.
 *
 * When linking with qblk_qmalloc, blocks are allocated one by one from qmalloc,
 * without pool. In this case, the release of a chain of blocks is no longer
 * O(1).
