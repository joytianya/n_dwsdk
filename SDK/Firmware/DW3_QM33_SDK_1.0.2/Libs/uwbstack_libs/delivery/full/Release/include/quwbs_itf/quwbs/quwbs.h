/**
 * DOC: QUWBS API
 *
 * Initialization and context
 * --------------------------
 *
 * The QUWBS API must be initialized before use. The context pointer used with quwbs_init() must be
 * given to all other QUWBS functions requiring a context. Some functions do not take the QUWBS
 * context directly because it may be stored inside another QUWBS object.
 *
 * When done, the API can be closed using quwbs_exit(). On embedded targets, this can be skipped and
 * the terminating functions will be removed at link stage.
 *
 *
 * Asynchronous API
 * ----------------
 *
 * The main offered API is asynchronous. This means that no function blocks waiting for an operation
 * to complete. Instead, when an operation is submitted and can not be completed immediately, the
 * function returns immediately and a callback will be called later with the result.
 *
 * If a function can trigger a callback, this is described in the function documentation.
 *
 * The QUWBS API does not create threads. This means that the application must call the QUWBS API so
 * that it can handle events when they are ready to be handled. The way to do this is platform
 * dependant as the application main loop must be able to determine whether QUWBS API has some work
 * to do. However, the synchronous API can be used to handle the platform dependant part.
 *
 *
 * Synchronous API
 * ---------------
 *
 * A synchronous interface is provided for simple use cases. Functions from the synchronous API can
 * block until the requested operation is complete. This has the limitation that the caller thread
 * can no longer handle several tasks in parallel, but the code may be simpler to write.
 *
 * Thread safety
 * -------------
 *
 * The QUWBS API is designed to be used from a single context of execution. If client needs to
 * access it from several contexts, it needs to protect itself from accessing QUWBS API from several
 * contexts at the same time.
 *
 * The asynchronous QUWBS API is reentrant, when client code is called from a callback function, it
 * can use any asynchronous QUWBS API function.

/**
 * DOC: Cookies and channels
 *
 * Internal.
 *
 * UWBMAC API had channels to match netlink sockets. On UCI, there is no such thing, so the UCI back
 * end had to try translating cookies to channels with more or less success. Just stop doing this,
 * do not try to implement a non-existing feature. Users who want to handle cookies will have to do
 * it themself, but many do not care and for them the interface is now simpler.

 * @QUWBS_DEVICE_STATE_STOPPED:
 *      Device is stopped, MAC configuration and low level calibration can be changed. UWB timestamp
 *      may be stopped. Firmware may transition automatically out of this state to the READY state
 *      at boot.
 * @QUWBS_DEVICE_STATE_READY:
 *	Device is ready to start sessions or protocols.
 * @QUWBS_DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE:
 *	Device is active, there is at least one active session or protocol. Transition to this state
 *	is automatic as soon as a session is started or a protocol enters an active state, meaning
 *	that the medium is being accessed. When no session and no protocol access the medium, device
 *	transitions automatically to the READY state.
 * @QUWBS_DEVICE_STATE_ERROR:
 *	Device is in an unrecoverable error state and must be restarted.
 *
 * Internal Only: This is a merge of FiRa Based Session device state and MAC state. When starting
 * the MAC, device goes to READY state. When a session or a protocol is started, it signals the MAC
 * that it starts. The MAC counts the number of starts and stops and adjust its READY/ACTIVE state
 * accordingly. This allows to remove intelligence from the UCI layer and centralise information in
 * the MAC. On boot, if no persistent calibration is available, the device can be kept in the
 * STOPPED state until a calibration is received.
